PythonHelloWorld
================
This is a HELLO WORLD example in python language.

Python 2.0 print "Hello, World!"

Python 3.0 print("Hello, World!")

If you are using Python 3.0 or above, then print will be written like this as print is now a function (hence the parenthesis) instead of a statement.

Include the code
input('Press ENTER to exit')
so that your console won't close immediately.
